# DigitalClock
A digital clock based upon the classic **7-segment display!** This project in total is just 35KB in size corresponsing to the fact that there is no use of texts or images anywhere. **SVGs and data structures in javascript** are the only heroes here. No external libraries or frameworks were used.<br/>
